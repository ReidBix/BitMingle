# BitMingle

BitMingle, a distributed Bitcoin mixing protocol with participation rewards.

### How it works

BitMingle is a distributed Bitcoin mixing protocol much like [CoinShuffle](https://www.petsymposium.org/2014/papers/Ruffing.pdf). However, BitMingle offers an incentive for non-launderers to add their coins to the pool; namely, a small amount of "interest" which launderers pay to the other participants.
